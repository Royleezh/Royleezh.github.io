# About Me

<img src="https://Royleezh.github.io/pfp2.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zongheng Li (李宗恒)**.<br>
Pronouns: He/him/his
I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, where I developed strong foundations in geology. This fall (September 2025), I will embark on my graduate journey by pursuing a Master of Science in Geotechnical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, aiming to deepen my expertise in engineering geology.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - zongheng0205 [at] outlook.com

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a RA position for 2025 summer research. If you need any additional information, please contact me. Thank you!</font>**

## Research Interests

- Geotechnical engineering
- Soil behavior, mechanics and improvement
- Rock mechanics
- Structural geology
- Geological hazards assessment and mitigation

My current research focuses on developing climate-resilient biogeotechnical solutions for landslide mitigation, with an emphasis on bridging bio-mediated soil stabilization mechanisms with real-world engineering applications. Specifically, I'm interested in analysis of fracture network formation behavior and multi-factor coupled response in bio-mediated soil improvement and feasibility study on bio-mediated soil improvement techniques for slope stabilization under multi-climate scenarios.
